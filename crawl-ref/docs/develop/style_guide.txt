Description style guide
=======================

Flavour text in Crawl varies quite widely in its style, but there are a few
guidelines that should be kept to in order to improve consistency and keep
descriptions useful.

These guidelines apply mostly to descriptions (visible with the ?/ lookup
command in-game, and via various other methods depending on what is being
examined), but some of them can be generalised to other flavour text.

General guidelines
==================

* Be brief! Most descriptions should only be a a couple of sentences long.
  Longer descriptions may fit for particularly notable subjects like unique
  monsters and unrand items.
* Where possible, avoid referring to the player as "you", and in particular
  don't tell the player what they think or feel (such as "You are scared of
  it.") There are cases when monster and player behaviour differs and so it's
  necessary to refer to the player directly, but otherwise descriptions should
  try to refer to a nonspecific "user" of an ability, spell or item.

Monster descriptions
====================

* Describe the monster in the singular, and avoid referring to "this"/"these"
  monsters: "A big rat. It has scary teeth."
* Note that many gameplay-relevant details will be automatically documented
  (see describe.cc), so the description can often focus on flavour rather than
  explaining what the monster does in-game.
* Ensure that any flavour descriptions don't give a misleading picture of what
  the monster is actually able to do.

Spell and ability descriptions
==============================

* Directly describe what the ability does, in the present tense: "Confuses the
  targeted creature."
* Focus on the mechanics of the ability, with as much detail as possible. The
  way the effect scales with power, the types of targets that are affected, and
  any special-cased functionality (such as ignoring armour or evasion) should
  all be mentioned.
* Avoid duplicating information in the description text that is already
  automatically documented by the game (for example noise level for spells,
  special costs such as draining for abilities).

Item descriptions
=================

* Describe the item in the singular, and use the present tense for details of
  what the item does: "A magic scroll. It causes the reader to teleport."
* Be aware that some items (such as weapons, armour and spellbooks) have most
  of their gameplay details automatically documented, and so have more room for
  flavour in the description. Others (such as jewellery, consumables and
  evocable items) need to focus on mechanics in the description.
